# Computer-Vision-with-Python

If you are a beginner in OpenCV programming, then this Cource may be helpful in providing a insight towards the basic image processing algorithms and its functions available in OpenCV.

Learn the basic image processing functions available in OpenCV through the examples provided in the [github](https://github.com/reddyprasade/Computer-Vision-with-Python). Here is a list of algorithms you can experiment on to make OpenCV handy.

* Load, Display and Save an image
* Capture Video from Webcam
* Basic drawing examples
* Convert RGB to gray / other color spaces
* Threshold operation
* Bilateral Filter / Gaussian Filter / Median Filter
* 2D Convolution / Creating new filter
* Sobel Edge Detection / Laplacian operator
* Hough Circle Detection
* Histogram Calculation
* Erosion or dilation
* Bitwise AND, OR, XOR and NOT
* Face Detection using Haar-Cascade Classifier
